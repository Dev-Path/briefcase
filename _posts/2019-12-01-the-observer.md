It's a hug, Michael. I'm hugging you. Get me a vodka rocks. And a piece of toast. I'm afraid I just blue myself. He'll want to use your yacht, and I don't want this thing smelling like fish.

First place chick is hot, but has an attitude, doesn't date magicians. First place chick is hot, but has an attitude, doesn't date magicians. Not tricks, Michael, illusions. I'm a monster. __No!__ *I was ashamed to be SEEN with you.* I like being with you.

## Whoa, this guy's straight?

Michael! Marry me. Now, when you do this without getting punched in the chest, you'll have more fun. We just call it a sausage. I hear the jury's still out on science. I'm afraid I just blue myself.

1. Not tricks, Michael, illusions.
2. I'm a monster.
3. No… but I'd like to be asked!

* Army had half a day.

Bad news. Andy Griffith turned us down. He didn't like his trailer. Really? Did nothing cancel? I'm half machine. I'm a monster. Now, when you do this without getting punched in the chest, you'll have more fun.

Well, what do you expect, mother? I hear the jury's still out on science. But I bought a yearbook ad from you, doesn't that mean anything anymore? It's a hug, Michael. I'm hugging you.
