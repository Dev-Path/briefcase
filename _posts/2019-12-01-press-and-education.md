## Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all

Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head. Tell them I hate them. I'm a thing. I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger.

One hundred dollars. Oh sure! Blame the wizards! We're rescuing ya. __Oh right.__ *I forgot about the battle.* Who are you, my warranty?!

## Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved

I was all of history's great robot actors - Acting Unit 0.8; Thespomat; David Duchovny! Please, Don-Botâ€¦ look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file! What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso!

1. Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony?
2. I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him.
3. What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso!

### Anyone who laughs is a communist

A sexy mistake. Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy. Who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere? Ugh, it's filthy! Why not create a National Endowment for Strip Clubs while we're at it?

* I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope?
* Whoa a real live robot; or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume?
* So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct?
