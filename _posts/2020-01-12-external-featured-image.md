You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME! I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in. Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time!

I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. *catches himself* And that is not how I'm introducing myself. You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. __Call me the Rotmeister.__ *No, I'm the Doctor.* Don't call me the Rotmeister.

## No, I'll fix it I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister

I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship. I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in. I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me!

1. You've swallowed a planet!
2. You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better?
3. I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship.

### *Insistently* Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do

It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'! Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff. It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool. You hit me with a cricket bat.

* Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish.

I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship. Did I mention we have comfy chairs? Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you?

Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. Saving the world with meals on wheels. All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong? They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens!

The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.…hey.…the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant. I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me!

I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks! Did I mention we have comfy chairs? It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool. I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why.
