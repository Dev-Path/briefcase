Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose. There's no part of that sentence I didn't like! You guys realize you live in a sewer, right? It may comfort you to know that Fry's death took only fifteen seconds, yet the pain was so intense, that it felt to him like fifteen years. And it goes without saying, it caused him to empty his bowels.

No, I'm Santa Claus! Say what? Okay, I like a challenge. Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them? I can explain. __It's very valuable.__ *Yes!* In your face, Gandhi!

## No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires

Is today's hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient? You're going back for the Countess, aren't you? Oh right. I forgot about the battle. I love you, buddy! Robot 1-X, save my friends! And Zoidberg!

1. It may comfort you to know that Fry's death took only fifteen seconds, yet the pain was so intense, that it felt to him like fifteen years. And it goes without saying, it caused him to empty his bowels.
2. Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as "the brig".
3. With gusto.

### Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court

Well I'da done better, but it's plum hard pleading a case while awaiting trial for that there incompetence. Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop, and he's an idiot! Well, that's love for you. Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars.

* Bender, we're trying our best.
* Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them?
* Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression!

Hey! I'm a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think? Okay, I like a challenge. Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets? You guys realize you live in a sewer, right? Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence?

Yeah, lots of people did. What kind of a father would I be if I said no? Aww, it's true. I've been hiding it for so long. Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock.

I love this planet! I've got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring. And yet you haven't said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you? Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way?

Are you crazy? I can't swallow that. You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from intestinal parasites? You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to see! Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head.

Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy. No! The cat shelter's on to me. Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets! In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms. Oh, I think we should just stay friends.

I'm a thing. No! Don't jump! Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no booze and only one hooker. It doesn't look so shiny to me. No! The cat shelter's on to me. This is the worst kind of discrimination: the kind against me!

Why yes! Thanks for noticing. They're like sex, except I'm having them! Whoa a real live robot; or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume? No argument here.

Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket. Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood!

I don't want to be rescued. I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him. No, of course not. It was… uh… porno. Yeah, that's it.

Why did you bring us here? You are the last hope of the universe. Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be. I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there!

I had more, but you go ahead. Hello, little man. I will destroy you! Throw her in the brig. Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars.
