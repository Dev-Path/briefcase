If you are a software developer, [github](https://github.com) helps you build all sort of great things. Things that help people, things that could land you a job, things that could change the world and some things that might not. Github is one place that can help you tell the world about all the great things that you are building.

Not bill boards or Inmails, these days you could build a website and there are a lot of options out there.

As a developer or someone in the tech industry, one of the technologies or tools you'd want to master is git and github.

I'm not gonna walk you through how to use git and github, that'd be reinventing the wheel. Instead I'm gonna point you in a very good direction.
It happens Github has a learning lab that can walk you through how to use the technology - I found this out later after struggling many times to find a a good and hands-on resource that could really help me master git and github.
