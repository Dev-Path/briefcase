    <p>Memoirs theme has Prism highlighter integrated. I will show you in this post a few examples of how it looks if you are a developer planning to add pieces of code on your website.
<img src="/assets/img/mindfulness.jpg" alt="mindset" /></p>

<p>People think they see things as they are.</p>
<blockquote>

  <p>There’s a group of people who I think are somewhat self-aware who do agree that “Indeed, I’m sure I’m wrong about some things. I’m sure I have some biases,” because everyone does.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We think we see things to be what they are. Also, I routinely see this contention on the web. In case somebody’s debating on Twitter, “I’m simply disclosing to you present reality.” And it resembles, all things considered, they have their inclination and their political belief and thereafter a severe teaching, and some arrangement of realities that they sort of have misread. Furthermore, one may remark, “I’m only mentioning to you what’s straight before the entirety of our eyes,” and it’s rarely the equal. You know, we may get as philosophical as we need concerning how our brains construct reality, but at the end of the day, nobody truly appears to see things how they are. All we can do is get closer, right?</p>

<h2 id="hold-your-identity-lightly">Hold Your Identity Lightly</h2>

<p>Attempt to carry your identity more lightly, try to retain a little bit more emotional distance from your beliefs. Thus you can in any case label yourself, you know, whatever it is you are, yet try to hold that all the more lightly. So that involves something like reminding yourself that label is changeable. So indeed, you are whatever you call yourself right now since that label describes your beliefs, but if you were to conclude that belief is wrong or harmful, then you would not hold those beliefs anymore.
So essentially, you’re trying to make the label feel like just a label and not like a flag that you’re waving or a badge that you’re wearing.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There’s a category of people who I believe are somewhat more mindful who might somehow agree and say “Indeed, I’m certain I’m biased with regards to certain things, I’m certain I have a few inclinations,” since everybody does. Yet, there will never be a second where they’re similar to, “Gracious, indeed, this is a thing that I may be wrong about.”</p>
</blockquote>

<div align="center">
  <img src="/assets/img/category.gif" alt="category" width="100%" />
</div>

<p>At the point when you’re wrong or when you’re biased, it never really feels like you are in the moment. <strong>So it takes some true sort of confidence</strong> in the external view that like, even though it seems like I’m most certainly right, there is some possibility that I’m not because everybody’s biased with regards to bunches of things and I’ve been biased in the past. Thus you need to sort of do that theoretical jump in your mind to override your certainty that for this situation you’re most certainly right.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/extent.jpg" alt="extent" /></p>

<h2 id="why-we-misunderstand-arguments-as-people">Why We Misunderstand Arguments As People</h2>

<p>We misunderstand arguments because our brains sort of match them with statements that we’ve heard before. So it’s so difficult to learn from arguments with people with various perspectives from you because I think we sort of anticipate that it should be more straightforward than it is.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/argue.jpg" alt="argue" /></p>

<p>By which, I mean, we will, in general, have this implicit assumption that well, assuming people are being sensible and arguing with the best of intentions, it ought to be clear who’s right, and that person should change their perspective. Thus assuming that doesn’t occur, you get disappointed, and you feel like, “Well, these people are being unreasonable and they’re stubborn and close-minded,” and you sort of discount them. That assumption kind of backfires and makes it harder for you to learn from disagreements because you think that everyone is being stubborn and close-minded.  </p>

<h2 id="is-my-mindset-tied-to-my-identity">Is My Mindset Tied To My Identity?</h2>

<p>A lot of things, after all, come down to identity, don’t they? Our beliefs frequently shape our identity. Politics and religion are the most obvious examples of beliefs that become part of our identity. Being a liberal, traditionalist, libertarian, nonbeliever, or Baptist, for example, is part of our identities in the sense that we are proud to be a skeptic, a Baptist, or a liberal. We take it personally when someone disagrees with us on these topics, and it quickly becomes an attack on us as a person rather than an attack on something we happen to believe. As a result, it is customary not to bring up politics or religion during a social gathering or date.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All things equal, you want to let a few things into your identity as possible, if you need to have the option to think as clearly as could be expected.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“I’ll try not to label myself in any way, so that my thinking isn’t skewed. As a result, I’m going to avoid using political labels. I’m going to try not to think of myself as a vegan or skeptic.” The problem is that this isn’t a strategic option. Labels are helpful for simply expressing your beliefs and decisions. Furthermore, it’s probably not a good idea to reject all feelings of attachment to your political convictions.</p>

<h2 id="what-can-i-do-instead">What Can I Do Instead?</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/img/instead.jpg" alt="instead" /></p>

<p>So, instead, you can try to hold your identity more lightly, attempting to maintain a little bit more emotional distance from your beliefs. Thus, you can call yourself a skeptic or whatever you want; however, try to do so with caution. That entails things like reminding yourself that the label is conditional. So, yes, I’m a religious activist because it best describes my beliefs. But if I concluded that activism is wrong or harmful, I would cease to be an activist. So, essentially, you’re attempting to make the label feel like it’s just a label, rather than a flag you’re waving or a badge you’re wearing.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-want-to-consider">What You Want To Consider</h2>

<p>All things considered, I mean, it’s additionally for all intents and purposes if you would like to persuade anybody that they’re wrong, it’s simply an awful strategic choice to make your case in a very self-righteous and self-congratulatory way, because regardless of whether you are correct, regardless of whether you do have valid justifications for holding your belief, assuming you say it simply in a tone dribbling with loftiness, you’re not going to change anyone’s mind.</p>

<p>No doubt I believe that is another — people often worry, “Well, you have to hold your belief strongly, or you’ll never change the world. You’ll never prevail upon hearts and minds,” - however practically speaking, more often than not, holding your beliefs strongly tied to your identity makes you worse at effecting change because it makes people not want to listen to you.</p>
